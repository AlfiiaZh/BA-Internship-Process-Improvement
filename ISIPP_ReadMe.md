## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents a business analysis case focused on analyzing and improving an internship placement process for a mid-sized education and career advisory organization.

The organization experienced increased application volumes while relying on manual, email-driven workflows. As a Business Analyst, my role was to analyze the current process, identify inefficiencies, and design an optimized future-state process supported by clear business and functional requirements.

## 🎯 Business Problem

The existing internship placement process suffered from:
- Heavy reliance on manual data entry and spreadsheets  
- Email-dependent communication with limited visibility  
- Delayed feedback loops for students and partner organizations  
- Lack of standardized tracking and performance metrics  

These issues resulted in longer placement cycles, higher administrative workload, and reduced stakeholder satisfaction.
